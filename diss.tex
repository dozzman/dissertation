\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

{\bf Pinkbook says at most 100 words describing the original aims of the project, e.g. use LWT to create parallelism in OCaml-Java, see how well this scales in comparisson to normal LWT, etc }

To write a demonstration dissertation\footnote{A normal footnote without the
complication of being in a table.} using \LaTeX\ to save
student's time when writing their own dissertations. The dissertation
should illustrate how to use the more common \LaTeX\ constructs. It
should include pictures and diagrams to show how these can be
incorporated into the dissertation.  It should contain the entire
\LaTeX\ source of the dissertation and the Makefile.  It should
explain how to construct an MSDOS disk of the dissertation in
Postscript format that can be used by the book shop for printing, and,
finally, it should have the prescribed layout and format of a diploma
dissertation.


\section*{Work Completed}
{\bf Pinkbook says at most 100 words summarising work completed, e.g. scheduler of LWT to OCaml-Java threads, worker public/private queue structure, benchmarks, etc.}
All that has been completed appears in this dissertation.

\section*{Special Difficulties}
{\bf Pinkbook says at most 100 words describing special difficulties, but most should just say "None" }
Learning how to incorporate encapulated postscript into a \LaTeX\
document on both CUS and Thor.

\section*{Declaration}

I, Dorian Peake of St John's College, being a candidate for Part II of the Computer
Science Tripos, hereby declare
that this dissertation and the work described in it are my own work,
unaided except as may be specified below, and that the dissertation
does not contain material that has already been used to any substantial
extent for a comparable purpose.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
{\bf Pinkbook doesn't say anything about an acknowledgements section..., don't think there should be with that declaration I'm meant to have signed anyway}
This document owes much to an earlier version written by Simon Moore
.  His help, encouragement and advice was greatly 
appreciated.
